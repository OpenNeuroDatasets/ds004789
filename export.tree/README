### Delayed Free Recall of Word Lists

#### Description
This dataset contains behavioral events and intracranial electrophysiological recordings from a delayed free recall task.  The experiment consists of participants studying a list of words, presented visually one at a time, completing simple arithmetic problems that function as a distractor, and then freely recalling the words from the just-presented list in any order.  The data was collected at clinical sites across the country as part of a collaboration with the Computational Memory Lab at the University of Pennsylvania.

#### To Note
* The iEEG recordings are labeled either "monopolar" or "bipolar."  The monopolar recordings are referenced (typically a mastoid reference), but should always be re-referenced before analysis.  The bipolar recordings are referenced according to a paired scheme indicated by the accompanying bipolar channels tables.
* Each subject has a unique montage of electrode locations.  MNI and Talairach coordinates are provided when available.
* Recordings done with the Blackrock system are in units of 250 nV, while recordings done with the Medtronic system are estimated through testing to have units of 0.1 uV.  We have completed the scaling to provide values in V.
